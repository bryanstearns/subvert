subvert - Store system configuration files in a source-code control system
and link them into place

---
Current version available from git://github.com/bryanstearns/subvert.git

(I realize the irony here: currently, the only supported source code 
control system is Subversion; I haven't needed to add Git support, but 
will add it soon.)

/subvert is an svn checkout tree that mirrors the file system structure;
files and directories are hardlinked/softlinked (respectively) to their 
positions in the real filesystem.

A configuration file, /subvert/subvert.conf, lists groups of files to
be installed ("subverted") together. This subvert tool manages that file,
performs installs using it, and can report on the status of subverted files.

Example: we're managing Apache configuration, including the file
/etc/httpd/conf/http.conf and an entire subdirectory /etc/httpd/sites.
subvert.conf contains this:
  [apache]
  /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
  /etc/httpd/sites/

"subvert --apply apache" would rename /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf to
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.orig and hardlink our version in its place,
then would softlink our /etc/httpd/sites into the /etc/httpd directory.

"subvert --check" would report which subverted files have been changed
and/or had their hard links broken.

"subvert --add new_key /usr/local/bin/foo" would hardlink the existing
file /usr/local/bin/foo into /subvert/local/bin/foo and add an entry
to subvert.conf for it, within the [new_key] group (creating that
group if necessary. It would also "svn add" the new file, but not
commit it.

"subvert --apply some_key" installs the files & directories associated
with the [some_key] group.

"subvert --help" explains more.
